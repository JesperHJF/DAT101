      <li>Where should you use constants, and where should you use variables? Can they all be constants?</li>
      <p>
				Constants should only be used when the value is not meant to change during the programs execution. Variables should be used when the value is expected to be changed later in the programs execution.
        If all values were constants, the program would be very limited in its functionality.
			</p>
      <li>How do parentheses affect the arithmetic outcome of an expression?</li>
      <p>
				Parentheses affect the arithmetic outcome by changing the order of operations. Operations within parentheses are performed first, followed by multiplication and division, and finally addition and subtraction.
			</p>
      <li>How do we limit floating-point numbers to a given number of decimals?</li>
      <p>
				We can limit floating-point numbers to a given number of decimals by using the toFixed() method, which formats a number using fixed-point notation.
			</p>
      <li>How can we compare two floating-point values to see if they are equal (is 12.199999 the same as 12.2)?</li>
      <p>
				We can compare two floating-point values by checking if the absolute difference between them is smaller than a very small number (epsilon). This accounts for potential precision errors in floating-point arithmetic.
			</p>
      <li>What do comparison operators return, and how can we check if they are FALSE or TRUE?</li>
      <p>
				Comparison operators return a boolean value, either TRUE or FALSE, based on the comparison of two values. We can check if they are FALSE or TRUE by using conditional statements like if-else or by directly logging the result to the console.
			</p>
      <li>How does the Math.random() function work, and what can it be used for?</li>
      <p>
				Math.random() creates a random floating-point number between 0 and 1. It can be used to generate a random value which can later be manipulated and used in functions and calculations.
			</p>
      <li>What is modulus (%), and when do we need this operator in mathematical operations?</li>
      <p>
				Modulus can be used to find the remainder of a division operation. It is useful in various scenarios, such as determining if a number is even or odd, cycling through a set of values, or constraining a value within a specific range.
