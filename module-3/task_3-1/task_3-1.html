      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p> We can test what the wake-up time is by using the if, else if and else functions. If the wake-up time is 7, the program will print that we can take the bus to school. If it is not 7, nothing will happen. </p>
      <li>Same as question #1. However the answer should now be different. Discuss the behavior of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>When the wake-up time is exactly 7, the program will print that I can take the bus to school. If the wake-up time is not 7, the program will print that I have to take the car to school.</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p>If the wake-up time is less than 7 or greater than 8, the program will print that I have to take the car to school.</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
      <p>If the number is 0, the program will print "Zero". Zero is neither a positive nor negative number. Although if 0 was defined as a boolean, 0 would equal false.</p>
