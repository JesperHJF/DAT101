      <li>1. What is the difference between invoking and creating a function?</li>
      <p>When invoking a function, the function is executed or called to perform its task. Creating a function involves defining the function's code and behavior but does not necessarily execute it.</p>
      <li>2. Explain the syntax regarding semicolons and code blocks.</li>
      <p>Semicolons are required after a line of code to signify that the current statement has ended. Code blocks are enclosed in curly braces {} to group multiple statements together and do not require semicolons at the end.</p>
      <li>3. What happens when we try to store values from a function when it doesn't return any?</li>
      <p>When we try to store values from a function that doesn't return anything, the result is undefined because the function does not provide a value to be stored.</p>
      <li>4. How do we separate parameters from each other when creating a function?</li>
      <p>We separate parameters from each other using commas when defining a function.</p>
      <li>5. Explain how parameter names are related during the invocation and creation of a function.</li>
      <p>Parameter names can be different during invocation and creation, but the order and number of arguments must match the parameters defined in the function.</p>
      <li>6. Explain why a parameter is undefined when a function call is missing a parameter.</li>
      <p>When a function call is missing a parameter, the corresponding parameter in the function definition is assigned the value undefined because no argument was provided for it.</p>
      <li>7. Explain what happens when we use recursive functions.</li>
      <p>Recursive functions call themselves in order to solve smaller instances of the same problem, typically until a base case is reached to stop the recursion.</p>
